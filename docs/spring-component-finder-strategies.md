# Spring component finder strategies

Included in the `structurizr-spring` library are a number of component finder strategies that help you identify components in Spring applications, including those built using Spring Boot.

* __SpringMvcControllerComponentFinderStrategy__: A component finder strategy that finds Spring MVC controllers (classes annotated `@Controller`).
* __SpringRestControllerComponentFinderStrategy__: A component finder strategy that finds Spring REST controllers (classes annotated `@RestController`).
* __SpringServiceComponentFinderStrategy__: A component finder strategy that finds Spring services (classes annotated `@Service`).
* __SpringComponentComponentFinderStrategy__: A component finder strategy that finds Spring components (classes annotated `@Component`).
* __SpringRepositoryComponentFinderStrategy__: A component finder strategy for Spring repositories (classes annotated `@Repository`, plus those that extend `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository`).
* __SpringComponentFinderStrategy__: A combined component finder strategy that uses all of the individual strategies listed above.

## Spring naming conventions and interfaces vs implementation classes

Some of the Spring annotations (e.g. `@Component`, `@Service` and `@Repository`) are typically used to annotate _implementation classes_.
For example, a `JdbcCustomerRepository` class might be annotated `@Repository`, rather than the `CustomerRepository` interface.
This component finder strategy tries to refer to interface types rather than implementation classes, based upon the following assumptions:

1. Having a component named `CustomerRepository` is preferable to `JdbcCustomerRespository`.
2. Other types in the codebase will likely have a dependency on the interface type (e.g. via dependency injection) rather than being coupled to the implementation class.

Given that a class can implement any number of interfaces, for a given implementation class, the component finder strategies will try to find the interface where the name of that interface is included in the name of the implementation class (i.e. `*Interface`, `Interface*` and `*Interface*`).
For example, the following implementation classes will match an interface named `CustomerRepository`:

* `JdbcCustomerRepository`
* `CustomerRepositoryImpl`
* `JdbcCustomerRepositoryImpl`

## Public vs non-public types

By default, non-public types will be ignored so that, for example, you can hide repository implementations behind services, as described at [Whoops! Where did my architecture go](http://olivergierke.de/2013/01/whoops-where-did-my-architecture-go/). Use the `setIncludePublicTypesOnly` method to change this behaviour.

## Example

You can see an example of how to use the Spring component finder strategies in the [Spring PetClinic example](spring-petclinic.md).
